    "Definition": "You will be shown a protein. Your job is to describe {Biological Summary}, and this protein should be {Relationship Summary}. {Task-Specific Relationship}",

    "Relationship Summary": "involved in the function",
    "Biological Summary": "function(s) of a protein",
    "Task-Specific Relationship": "This response provides any useful information about the protein, mostly biological knowledge. When a protein is a precursor of different chains/peptides having different functions, specify the role of each peptide in separate paragraphs. The same holds true for isoform-specific functions. Multifunctional enzymes should have only one 'Function' section for the different activities. When a protein displays some very different or contradictory functions depending on the context, describe them in different sentences. This case is rare.",
