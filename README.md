# ProCyon: A multimodal foundation model for protein phenotypes
![ProCyon logo](assets/procyon_logo_large.png)

ProCyon is an open-source model for predicting protein phenotypes across scales.
This repository provides the official implementation of the model as described in our [overview page](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ProCyon) and our [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.10.627665v1).
Our associated HuggingFace collection containing model weights and datasets can be found at the following links:

- Dataset: [ProCyon-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mims-harvard/ProCyon-Instruct)
- Full model: [ProCyon-Full](https://huggingface.co/mims-harvard/ProCyon-Full)
- Benchmarking model: [ProCyon-Split](https://huggingface.co/mims-harvard/ProCyon-Split)
- Binding prediction model: [ProCyon-Bind](https://huggingface.co/mims-harvard/ProCyon-Bind)

## Installation
Requirements:
- CUDA toolkit, particularly `nvcc`

We recommend installing with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), but install can also be done via `pip` alone. The `procyon` package used to interact with pre-trained models or train new models can be installed via
```
cd /path/to/ProCyon

# RECOMMENDED: use uv to install. Two options depending on whether
#              you want to use the default .venv virtual env that
#              uv will create
# OPTION 1: let uv create and manage the virtual enviroment, requires
#           uv to already be installed
uv sync --extra build
uv sync --extra build --extra compile
uv pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate

# OPTION 2: create virtual environment with choice of name and path
python3 -m venv ./procyon_venv
source ./procyon_venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install uv
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --extra build
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --extra build --extra compile
uv pip install -e .

# OR if omitting uv
python3 pip install -e .
```
Installation with `uv` should take less than 10 minutes, depending on the
speed of your internet connection for downloading packages.

In addition to the package code, ProCyon also requires pre-trained weights for associated
models (e.g. Llama-3, ESM2) as well as access to the ProCyon-Instruct dataset.
You'll need to request access to the LLaMA-3 model through the model page [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B).
These dependencies
will all be stored in a single directory, which we denote `DATA_DIR`.

```
DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
mkdir $DATA_DIR
cd $DATA_DIR

# Clone ProCyon-Instruct dataset from HuggingFace
git clone git@hf.co:datasets/mims-harvard/ProCyon-Instruct

# Clone model weights for associated Llama models from HuggingFace
# Llama-3-8b for ProCyon-Full
cd /path/to/llama3/
# Ensure you've signed up for LLaMA-3 access
git clone https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B
echo "LLAMA3_PATH=/path/to/llama3/Meta-Llama-3-8B" >> .env

# Llama-2-7b for ProCyon-Split
cd ../llama-2-7b-hf
git clone git@hf.co:meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf

# Add a `.env` file which the `procyon` package will use to find the `DATA_DIR`
cd /path/to/ProCyon
echo "DATA_DIR=\"$DATA_DIR\"" > .env
echo "HOME_DIR=\"$(pwd)\"" >> .env
```

**Version note**: We are aware of a bug where having `transformers>4.31.0` changes generated model outputs. Please ensure your `transformers` version is set to 4.31.0 (as in environment requirements) for inference of ProCyon.

## Examples
For the core capabilities of ProCyon models, please see the provided demo
notebooks. Both examples should run in less than 5 minutes depending on the
speed of your GPU.
- [Phenotype generation](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ProCyon/blob/main/examples/phenotype_generation.ipynb)
- [Retrieval](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ProCyon/blob/main/examples/retrieval.ipynb)

To see how to perform benchmarking runs comparing the performance of ProCyon models to
various other baselines and models, please see the
[example configs and scripts](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ProCyon/blob/main/examples/evaluation)
or the [evaluation README](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ProCyon/blob/main/procyon/evaluate/README.md).

For details on how to reproduce the various experiments and results in our manuscript, please see
the [reproducibility README](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ProCyon/blob/main/examples/paper_analyses/README.md).
